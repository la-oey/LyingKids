		We are asking how kids use strategies when they play games with other people. Games like this involve thinking about what other people know and believe. How kids think about other people’s knowledge changes a lot over time. Preschoolers have a lot of trouble thinking about others’ beliefs, but by the time they start school, they start to find it very easy!<br><br>
		In this study, we want to know: how do kids lie when another person can catch them, and how do the kids catch lies? Do kids always tell the biggest lie that benefits them most, or do they give smaller lies if they think this will help them to not get caught?<br><br>
