			<b>Videotaping.</b> We would like to use your camera's webcam to take images of the study session for our records. In an image, it will be possible to identify yourself; however we will keep the recordings confidential and only approved study staff will be able to see them. We will store the recordings on our secure and password protected server, on a password-protected computer in a locked room, and/or in a locked cabinet, and label them with a code instead of your name. The recordings will be securely stored for ten years, and then deleted.<br><br>
