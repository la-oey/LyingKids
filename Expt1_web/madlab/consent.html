		<b>Why is this study being done?</b> Our research team is the Mind and Development Lab, a member of the Kid Science Labs at UCSD, under Prof. Adena Schachner. We are conducting this study to find out more about children’s developing understanding of the social and physical world. <br><br>
		<b>How long will this study take?</b> Our studies are very short (for example, 10 minutes) and your child’s participation will involve just one session, which should take no more than 1 hour.<br><br>
		<b>What will happen if my child takes part in this study?</b> Your child will participate in one or more short activities designed for children of their age. These activities will take place at your computer or mobile device with a webcam, from the comfort of your own home or location of choice. Your child may join a video call with a trained researcher, and/or listen to a short story, see a short puppet show or video, or play simple games. The researcher may ask your child questions about the story or game. Alternatively, you may be asked to interact with your child (for example, by singing, speaking, or playing with toys).<br><br>
		<b>Participation and withdrawal.</b> Taking part in this study is your and your child’s choice. You and your child are free to not take part or to withdraw at any time for any reason. There will be no penalty or loss of any benefit to which you and your child are entitled. Additionally, the researcher may withdraw your child from participating if the researcher believes that it is in the best interests of the child or the study.<br><br>
		<b>What are the risks of taking part in this study?</b> The study does not involve any risks beyond the risk of your child becoming bored but we try to avoid this by designing tasks to be fun and engaging to children. As with any study, there is a risk of loss of confidentiality, so we take many steps to ensure that the records of this study and your child’s participation are kept confidential.<br><br>
		<b>How will you keep my child’s study records confidential?</b> We will keep the records of this study confidential by storing them on our secure and password protected server, on a password-protected computer in a locked room, and/or in a locked cabinet; by identifying participants by ID codes rather than names; and by only allowing laboratory personnel access to research materials.<br><br>
		<b>Are there any benefits of being in this study? </b> Children typically enjoy participation, and you and your child may enjoy learning about this research on children’s development.<br><br>
		<b>Will we be paid for taking part in this study?</b> You will receive an online gift certificate (e.g. $5 Amazon gift card), which may be used to purchase a small gift for your child for participating in this research.<br><br>
		<b>What will it cost us to take part in this study?</b> Aside from time, there are no known costs to you for participating in this research study.<br><br>
		<b>If we have any questions or concerns about this study, who can I talk to?</b> If you or your child have questions or concerns regarding this research, either now or at any time in the future, please feel free to contact our research team (858-534-7713 or <a href="mailto:MaDlab@ucsd.edu">MaDlab@ucsd.edu</a>) or Prof. Adena Schachner (<a href="mailto:schachner@ucsd.edu">schachner@ucsd.edu</a>). You may also obtain information about your child’s rights as a research participant by contacting the Human Research Protections Program Office at 858-246-4777.<br><br>
