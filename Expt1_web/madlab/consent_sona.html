		<b>Why is this study being done?</b> Our research team is the Mind and Development Lab, a member of the Kid Science Labs at UCSD, under Prof. Adena Schachner. We are conducting this study to find out more about childrenâ€™s developing understanding of the social and physical world. <br><br>
		<b>How long will this study take?</b> Our studies are very short (for example, 10 minutes) and your participation will involve just one session, which should take no more than 1 hour.<br><br>
		<b>What will happen if I takes part in this study?</b> You will participate in one or more short activities that will take place at your computer or mobile device with a webcam, from the comfort of your own home or location of choice. For example, you may be asked to sort objects into categories, interact with a game, or answer questions about objects, videos or events you have seen.<br><br>
		<b>Participation and withdrawal.</b> Taking part in this study is your choice. You are free to not take part or to withdraw at any time for any reason. There will be no penalty or loss of any benefit to which you are entitled. If you later decide that you do not want the data that has been collected from your participation to be used for future research purposes, you may notify Prof. Adena Schachner, and she will make her best effort to stop any additional data use for studies. However, in some cases, if your data has been deidentified, she may be unable to locate and stop such future usage of this data.<br><br>
		<b>What are the risks of taking part in this study?</b> The study does not involve any risks beyond the risk of becoming bored but we try to avoid this by designing tasks to be fun and engaging. As with any study, there is a risk of loss of confidentiality, so we take many steps to ensure that the records of this study and your participation are kept confidential.<br><br>
		<b>How will you keep my study records confidential?</b> We will keep the records of this study confidential by storing them on our secure and password protected server, on a password-protected computer in a locked room, and/or in a locked cabinet; by identifying participants by ID codes rather than names; and by only allowing laboratory personnel access to research materials.<br><br>
		<b>Are there any benefits of being in this study? </b> You may enjoy learning about this research on cognition. Your participation will increase knowledge of how adults understand and reason about their social and physical environment.<br><br>
		<b>Will I be paid for taking part in this study?</b> You will receive course credit through the SONA system for your participation. You will receive 0.5 credit for a study session lasting 30 minutes or less, and 1 credit for a study session lasting between 30 minutes and 1 hour.<br><br>
		<b>What will it cost me to take part in this study?</b> Aside from time, there are no known costs to you for participating in this research study.<br><br>
		<b>If I have any questions or concerns about this study, who can I talk to?</b> If you have questions or concerns regarding this research, either now or at any time in the future, please feel free to contact our research team (858-534-7713 or <a href="mailto:MaDlab@ucsd.edu">MaDlab@ucsd.edu</a>) or Prof. Adena Schachner (<a href="mailto:schachner@ucsd.edu">schachner@ucsd.edu</a>).
