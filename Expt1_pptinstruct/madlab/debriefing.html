		Thanks for your help!<br><br>

		In this study, we are asking how kids think about other people when they play games. Games like this involve thinking about what other people know and believe. How kids think about this changes a lot as they grow up. Younger kids have a lot of trouble thinking about other people's beliefs and knowledge, but it gets easier as they grow up!<br><br>

		We want to know: At what ages do kids think about which 'tricks' other people will catch, and avoid those?  Do kids catch others' tricks by thinking about what the other person might know or want? If so, then kids are thinking about this the same way grown ups do!<br><br>
